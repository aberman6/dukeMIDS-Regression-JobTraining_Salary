# Overview
During the National Supported Work Demonstration (NSWD) study, researchers assessed whether or not job training for disadvantaged workers had an effect on their wages. Eligible workers were randomly assigned either to receive job training or not to receive job training. We analyze a subset of the data from the NSWD.*

We will use linear and logistic regression modeling to answer the following questions of interest.

* Is there evidence that workers who receive job training tend to earn higher wages than workers who do not receive job training? What is a likely range for the effect of training? Is there any evidence that the effects differ by demographic groups? 

* Is there evidence that workers who receive job training tend to be more likely to have positive (non-zero) wages than workers who do not receive job training? What is a likely range for the effect of training? Is there any evidence that the effects differ by demographic groups?
